How does the exploit work?
The exploit works by taking advantage on the Pearl Abyss launcher being HTML-5 based, when dragging the button to the launcher what's really happening is that you are dragging a link to download "UwUTools.exe", once you get the explorer pop-up while being focused on another executable, if you use the macro we are taking advantage of an un-patchable exploit, as the VM is constantly searching for a running instance of "explorer.exe" (only focused instances) you have small gaps between searches, the macro takes advantage by replacing Pearl Abyss Error Report Service (PERS.exe) via keyboard commands in less than a second (human-proof speeds, but possible for a computer) so the VM doesn't realize the explorer instance was focused by a second and it will keep the session open while having the Error Report Service replaced (as it's an authorized exe to run with GPU Permissions). The rext of the exploit it's self-explanatory. Run's the modified PERS.exe which is a custom app launcher and you got freedom to work with the VM.
